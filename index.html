        <p>I live in a house.</p>

        <p>At the front of my house, is a porch.</p>

        <p>On the porch, attached to the house, is a cow's skull.</p>

        <p>On the cow's skull, is a trucker's hat.</p>

        <p> On the hat, a robin had built a nest.</p>

        <p>In the nest, lay four blue eggs.</p>
      </div>

          I watched the eggs over the last few weeks hatch into babies.
          As the weeks progressed, the babies grew into little birds.
          I decided to make an effort to name and document their growth:
          <div>
            <ul>
              <li>Chirp</li>
              <li>Cheep</li>
              <li>Peep</li>
              <li>and...Tom</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </p>
      </div>

          A few days ago, I arrived home to discover all but one had flown away.
          I grabbed a beer from the fridge and sat anxiously on the swing, that is on the porch, in front of the bird
          nest,
          awaiting the final little one (Tom) to take flight.</p>
      </div>


      <div>
        <p> An hour had passed before Tom started fluttering his wings. Unassured of the result, he clenched his feet
          tightly
          to the edge of his loosely woven home.
        </p>


        <p>
          In a brave attempt, Tom rapidly flapped his newly found wings let go of the nest, and plummeted to the porch.</p>


        <p>After regaining his senses, Tom started to hop around curiously studying the environment that was thrust
          upon
          him.</p>

        <p>
          Eventually, he made his way to the front yard where he met his mother. She scurried along side him giving him
          flight 101 lessons as they made their way into the street.
        </p>

        <p>
          Tom's mother flew away, evading the Jeep mindlessly traveling down the road.</p>
        <div>
          <img src="#" alt="#">
        </div>
        <p>My heart was crushed, as was Tom's newly formed body.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p>
          In the nest, lay four empty shells.
