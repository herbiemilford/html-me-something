    <p>I live in a house.

      At the front of my house is a porch.

      On the porch attached to the house is a cow's skull.

      On the cow's skull is a trucker's hat.

      On the hat a robin had built a nest.

      In the nest lay four blue eggs.

    <p>
      I watched the eggs over the last few weeks hatch into babies.
      As the weeks progressed, the babies grew into little birds.
      I decided to make an effort to name and document their growth (Chirp, Cheep, Peep, and Tom)
    </p>
    <p>
      A few days ago I arrived home to discover all but one had flown away.
      I grabbed a beer from the fridge and sat anxiously on the swing, that is on the porch in front of the birds nest,
      awaiting the final little one (Tom) to take flight.
      An hour had passed before Tom started fluttering his wings. Unassured of the result, he clenched his feet tightly
      to the edge of his loosely woven home.

      In a brave attempt, Tom rapidly flapped his newly found wings let go of the nest and plummeted to the porch.
      After regaining his senses Tom started to hop around curiously studying the environment that was thrust upon him.

      Eventually he made his way to the front yard where he met his mother. She scurried along side him giving him
      flight 101 lessons as they made their way into the street.

      Tom's mother flew away evading the Jeep mindlessly traveling down the road.

      My heart was crushed as was Tom's newly formed body.

      Tom never flew.‚Äù
