          <p class="a">I live in a house.</p>

          <p>At the front of my house, is a porch.</p>

          <p>On the porch, attached to the house, is a cow's skull.</p>

          <p>On the cow's skull, is a trucker's hat.</p>

          <p> On the hat, a robin had built a nest.</p>

          <p>In the nest, lay four blue eggs.</p>

            I watched the eggs over the last few weeks hatch into babies.
            As the weeks progressed, the babies grew into little birds.
            I decided to make an effort to name and document their growth:
            <div id=birdnames>
              <ul>
                <li>Chirp</li>
                <li>Cheep</li>
                <li>Peep</li>
                <li>and...Tom</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="text-center" id="tom">

        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            A few days ago, I arrived home to discover all but one had flown away.
            I grabbed a beer from the fridge and sat anxiously on the swing, that is on the porch, in front of the bird
            nest,
            awaiting the final little one (Tom) to take flight.</p>
        </div>


        <div>
          <p> An hour had passed before Tom started fluttering his wings. Unassured of the result, he clenched his feet
            tightly
            to the edge of his loosely woven home.
          </p>


          <p>
            In a brave attempt, Tom rapidly flapped his newly found wings let go of the nest, and plummeted to the
            porch.</p>


          <p>After regaining his senses, Tom started to hop around curiously studying the environment that was thrust
            upon
            him.</p>

          <p>
            Eventually, he made his way to the front yard where he met his mother. She scurried along side him giving
            him
            flight 101 lessons as they made their way into the street.
          </p>

          <p>
            Tom's mother flew away, evading the Jeep mindlessly traveling down the road.</p>
          <div>

          <p>My heart was crushed, as was Tom's newly formed body.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <p>
            In the nest, lay four empty shells.
